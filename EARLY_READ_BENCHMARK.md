# Early-read benchmark

This branch adds a decode change: while storage is idle after each layer's
expert reads, read the expert the next layer most likely needs. The benchmark
below measures it with the
[community benchmark](docs/COMMUNITY_BENCHMARKS.md) prompts and settings, in
two stages:

1. Each case six times, in the order off, router, router ×2, router ×2,
   router, off: what the early read gives, guessing with the next layer's own
   router, reading one or two experts per layer.
2. The short case sixteen times, alternating router ×2 and fitted ×2 (a guess
   fitted for this model): eight side-by-side pairs, so slow changes in the
   Mac's speed over the run cancel within each pair.

## What you need

- An Apple Silicon Mac, macOS 26, Xcode 26 / Swift 6.2 or newer.
- About 20 GB free disk, an internet connection for the model download.
- About 3 hours with the Mac on power and otherwise idle.

## Steps

1. Clone this fork and check out this branch:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/maxslamdunk/turbo-fieldfare.git
   cd turbo-fieldfare
   git checkout early-expert-read-benchmark
   ```

2. Install the model (about 15 GB download), per the
   [README](README.md#command-line-interface):

   ```bash
   swift run -c release TurboFieldfareRepack --output scratch/gemma4.gturbo
   ```

   If you already installed it in another checkout, move that
   `scratch/gemma4.gturbo` folder here instead, or pass `MODEL=<its path>`
   to the script.

3. Build, close other apps, connect power, and run:

   ```bash
   swift build -c release --product TurboFieldfareCLI
   Scripts/benchmark-early-read.sh
   ```

4. When it finishes, the script prints a link. Open it: it is this fork's
   benchmark issue form with everything filled in from your runs. Check it and
   press **Submit**. You can drag `benchmark-results.zip` into the issue too.
   No GitHub account? Send `benchmark-results.zip` to whoever asked you.

   If the link does not work, `python3 Scripts/early-read-report.py` prints it
   again, and `benchmark-results/issue.md` has the same report to paste.

`benchmark-results/summary.txt` has one line per run: tokens per second, and
for runs with the early read on, how many of each token's expert reads were
already loaded and how often the guess was right. Its last lines check that
every run of a case produced identical text.
